            <p style = "font-size:25; font-family:'sans-serif'; color: maroon;">Hi! my name is anuvarshini , currently in my 
            B.tech second year specialising in cyber security at Amrita vishwa Vidyapeetham Coimbatore. I finished my schooling in paavai vidhyashram at my hometown , Namakkal. I was born in salem but I have been
            living in my hometown since my childhood.
            <br>
            <p style = "font-size:25; font-family:'sans-serif'; color: maroon;">I like to spend my alone time by listening to music and walking around . I prefer slow and pop music , it helps me relax over any busy day . I prefer <u>thriller</u> and <u>comedy</u> films and series because I get to laugh for something or the movie keeps me engaging.
            I also like watching about ancient civilisation and their technologies and few scientific theories which are interesting.  </p>
            </p>

                    In my ninth grade I got an opportunity to visit NASA and participate in their activites. There I got to 
                see many space related things like <i>rockets</i> , the <i>kind of food</i> astronauts should eat in space and they also put us in a simulator to have live experience on 
                how the rocket journey is for the astronauts.</li>
                <li style = "font-size:25; font-family:'sans-serif'; color: maroon;">I learnt to ride bicycle on my own , it was a <b>thrilling</b> experience I would like to share on my profile . It was scary at the start but as I started to get the balance I felt more confident.
